# BrainRover
A talking, animated brain for neuroscience education. Here is a [link](brainrover.github.io) to the site.

## How was this made?

Created over a year using WebGL, involved thousands of lines of code.

## Why?

There are models of the brain today that are meant for researchers and they are not available for the general public.
I have developed an open-source 3D model of the brain for everyday folks. 
In order to make it more modern and extensible, and run on everyday browsers, I have made it with JavaScript.
Would you like to know what happens in your brain when you hear a joke? BrainRover can help you do so!
