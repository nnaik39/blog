# SmartScarf

A wearable scarf + app alert system which monitors the temperature of sick people.

## What is this?

Temperature sensor combines with a scarf to detect
                  dangerously high temperature and calls an emergency contact.
## How does it work?

An Arduino has a temperature sensor, and when the sensor senses a temperature above a certain threshold, it sends an alert via Bluetooth LE to an Android app where the user has entered their contacts.

Here is a video of a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV9-raSKfyk), and a video I made showing the business [pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlYLmvjFcvo).
