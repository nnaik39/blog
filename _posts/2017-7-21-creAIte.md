This weekend, I’m really looking forward to getting middle and high school girls interested in AI and Art via my workshop [creAIte](aiandart.wixsite.com). We’ve got a hundred people who signed up within hours! Unfortunately, we could only accept about 40 of them. I am teaching for two days, on topics such as linear regression, neural networks, and fun stuff like style transfer and DeepDream! The workshop will be held at HackerDojo in Santa Clara on July 22nd and July 23rd from 10-3, and on the 23rd from 4-6, we will hold an art exhibition displaying what the students have made.

Stay tuned for pictures, slides, videos and updates!
