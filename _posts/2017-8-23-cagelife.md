My poem Cagelife has also been [published](https://therisingphoenixreview.com/2017/08/22/cagelife/) in the Rising Phoenix Review!
By the way, I would recommend checking out the other poetry up on that webzine. They're committed to diversity, so a lot of
the poetry is related to the various rights of minorities, LGBT+ rights, and some very relevant issues at the moment.

So how did this poem come about? Perhaps I can explain by showing how the first line popped into my head. For me, it was always
a mystery reading other poets' work--how did they even come up with that? I'd like to provide some sort of an explanation for
how ideas can make their way from my head to my writing.

I was interning in a biology lab over the summer, and the lab works with mice. So I ended up seeing many empty mouse
cages, scattered around the lab. I thought, "The first time a mouse enters a cage...," well, it's doomed from the start, isn't it?

When I was writing this poem, I sought to describe an experience--the experience of being trapped and longing to get out.
I was never quite thinking about a very literal meaning for it; however, I'm sure readers may be able to find some meaning, or possibly
personal parallels.

Again, I'd love it if you could check it out [here](https://therisingphoenixreview.com/2017/08/22/cagelife/) and offer me some feedback!
Thanks for reading!
