title: Decrypting the Enigma's History
---

It is lunchtime. The school exhales with the sound of running feet and furtively concealed food fights.

You stand at the soldering benches, hair tied back, with a soldering iron in your hands.
With pursed lips, you attempt to pry out a very stubborn pushbutton which has wedged itself firmly into the motherboard.
You press the desoldering wick to the wire, heat it up with the iron and pull!

During one of my independent projects this year, I created an Enigma, an encryption machine which the Germans used during World War II. I made it from Arduinos.

Here's the finished product:

## What's an Enigma, and why does it matter?

Here's a historical overview:

### Creation

In 1919, Arthur Scherbius of the company Scherbius & Ritter thought the cryptography used in World War I wasn't very good. He thought, Hey, I can make this better by mechanizing it! So he developed a mechanized cryptographic machine, and called it Enigma. Basically, his invention consisted of three elements, a keyboard, a scrambling unit for encryption, and a display board, all connected by wires.

Each time a new letter is encrypted, the scrambler disk rotates by one-sixth of a revolution! So in this case, if you type the letter F twice, then it will encrypt as a different letter. FF could be written as CA, or BE, or anything, really.

There's one glaring weakness here, though! If you type the letter F six times, then the scrambler disk returns to its original position. Scherbius fixed this by adding more scrambler disks. If you add one more scrambler disk, then it will take typing the letter F6 x 6 = 36 times to return it to its original position, which is way less likely to occur.

Scherbius added another scrambler disk! Question: how many times do you have to type the letter F now for all the disks to return to their original position? Also, how many total scrambler arrangements will there be with three scrambler disks?

He also added a reflector and a plugboard. Both swap pairs of letters.

### Military Adoption

German cryptographers didn't do so well during World War I. Valuable information kept falling into the hands of the British! To really rub it in, the British published two documents: the World Crisis by Winston Churchill and an official history of the First World War. In the first document, Churchill included a very dramatic account of how the British gained access to German cipher keys. In the second, the British Royal Navy emphasized how the weakness of German ciphers had provided the Allies with a huge advantage.

Both were published in 1923. In 1926, the Enigma entered military service (it was mass-produced a year earlier). Over the next 2 decades, the German government bought over 30,000 Enigma machines. They thought these machines would ensure the success of the Nazi regime--instead, they ultimately played a part in its downfall.

### Strengths

When I think about the Enigma, one of the first questions I have is, why did all the Germans consider the cipher so secure? And why did it take such a feat of mental strength to break it?

Remember that after every letter, the machine stepped forward by one. This means we can't just do straightforward frequency analysis on it. Rats.

The fact is, there is an overwhelming number of possible combinations. As we've already seen, it takes 26^3 letters before all the rotors return to their original position. Also, the number of combinations is 150 million million (which varied through the course of war and depended on the type). This number is simply too big for any person to check and still keep their sanity.

### Decipherment

Cracking the Enigma allowed the Allies to shorten World War II by several years! How'd they possibly check all those settings?

Theoretically, the Enigma is extremely hard to break. The factors that eventually led to its downfall weren't theoretical weaknesses. Rather, they were human errors--weaknesses in the way the machine was used.

First, the same settings were used for an entire day. This may seem reasonable; yet there are always "hard to crack" and "easy to crack" messages. So if the cryptanalysts manage to crack even one of the easy messages, then they can read every single message for that day.

So, every day there were two keys sent out: a day key and a message key. The day key was the one which all operators knew, and which was changed every day. Then each message had a message key, which was supposed to be a random sequence of three numbers. Keyword: supposed.

In the heat of battle, Enigma operators would often use the same message key over and over again! Moreover, they would often pick letters which were right next to each other, like QWE or GHJ. (The Enigma had a QWERTYUIOP keyboard.) One such predictable message key was called C.I.L, possibly the initials of the operator's girlfriend. Also, the 6AM weather report would always sign off with "Heil Hitler." From this we get the term cillies, which roughly means a weakness in the implementation of a cipher.

These cillies were helpful for decrypting the Enigma! Originally, I had a mathematics explanation as well, but this blog post was getting too long. So this concludes the historical explanation of the Enigma!
