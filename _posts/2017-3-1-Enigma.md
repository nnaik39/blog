title: Decrypting the Enigma's History
---

It is lunchtime. The school exhales with the sound of running feet and furtively concealed food fights.

You stand at the soldering benches, hair tied back, with a soldering iron in your hands.
With pursed lips, you attempt to pry out a very stubborn pushbutton which has wedged itself firmly into the motherboard.
You press the desoldering wick to the wire, heat it up with the iron and pull!

During one of my independent projects this year, I created an Enigma, an encryption machine which the Germans used during World War II. I made it from Arduinos.

Here's the finished product:

## What's an Enigma, and why does it matter?

Here's a historical overview:

### Creation

In 1919, Arthur Scherbius of the company Scherbius & Ritter thought the cryptography used in World War I wasn't very good. He thought, Hey, I can make this better by mechanizing it! So he developed a mechanized cryptographic machine, and called it Enigma. Basically, his invention consisted of three elements, a keyboard, a scrambling unit for encryption, and a display board, all connected by wires.

Each time a new letter is encrypted, the scrambler disk rotates by one-sixth of a revolution! So in this case, if you type the letter F twice, then it will encrypt as a different letter. FF could be written as CA, or BE, or anything, really.

There's one glaring weakness here, though! If you type the letter F six times, then the scrambler disk returns to its original position. Scherbius fixed this by adding more scrambler disks. If you add one more scrambler disk, then it will take typing the letter F6 x 6 = 36 times to return it to its original position, which is way less likely to occur.

Scherbius added another scrambler disk! Question: how many times do you have to type the letter F now for all the disks to return to their original position? Also, how many total scrambler arrangements will there be with three scrambler disks?

He also added a reflector and a plugboard. Both swap pairs of letters.
