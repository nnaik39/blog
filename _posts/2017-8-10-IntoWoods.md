title: Thoughts on Into the Woods
---


Steven Sondheim’s Into the Woods is an inverted fairy tale. It takes familiar characters like Cinderella and Red Riding Hood, and gives them their happy endings--in the first half. In the second half, the audience watches the glorious unraveling of “happy ever after”. This includes deaths, adultery, and so much more. It’s like realism a la George R.R. Martin. 

I am in the midst of a devout Sondheim phase. My reaction to Sondheim’s Into the Woods was, “Wow, the female characters are really strong!” For example, in “On the Steps of the Palace,” Cinderella makes a conscious decision to leave behind her shoe, singing, “You’ll just leave him a clue / For example: a shoe.”

She also decides at the end of the musical to leave her prince.
The whole musical is structured around the baker and his wife, wonderfully ordinary characters whose struggles are somewhat relatable to the audience. Going to balls in a pumpkin carriage and running away from giants aren’t struggles we normally face, so the baker and his wife are desperate for a child. Effectively, the baker couple serves as the audience’s portal into the magical woods.
Near the second half of the musical, where the happy endings begin falling apart, the characters, especially women, meet increasingly grisly deaths. Rapunzel is crushed when trying to escape from her tower. The baker’s wife is killed by the giantess (who chased Jack down the beanstalk to get revenge).
The gritty realism mixed with several fairy tales helps the audience relate to the story’s events. I interpreted the woods here as a metaphor for the real world, places where it can seem like your dreams are coming true, until a random event can derail your plans. Yet “Into the Woods” also has glimmers of hope--as it constantly reminds us, every person’s story begins with “I wish.”

My Favorite Songs: “On the Steps of the Palace”, “Agony”, “Maybe They’re Magic”
