title: Hibernation

My poem "Hibernation" was recently [picked up](https://therisingphoenixreview.com/2017/08/16/hibernation-by-nandita-naik/) by Rising Phoenix Review.

So why did I write this poem?
I've been having a lot of nightmares recently. I was wondering: is there a reason I'm getting these scary dreams?
Have I done something in my life that determines the subject matter of my dreams? More broadly, can I be held responsible for
what happens to my subconscious?

Every winter, bears enter hibernation, a deep sleep which slows down their breathing and allows them to save energy to survive
the cold winter. I wrote this piece to describe a relationship between being in a deep sleep and being guided by your instincts,
much like how an animal sees this word.

This piece ended up with a narrative arc. Basically, it describes a group of humans who are influenced by what they see
in their dreams and revert to more animalistic tendencies. I've been experimenting with enjambment and repetition, so that's reflected
here. I'd appreciate it if you'd check it out [here](https://therisingphoenixreview.com/2017/08/16/hibernation-by-nandita-naik/)! I think it's one of my favorite pieces so far!
