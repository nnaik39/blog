[![First Photograph](/res/)](https://petapixel.com/2013/10/02/first-photo/)

This is the first photograph that was ever taken. It was taken by Joseph Niepce around 1826. This is the view from an upstairs window at his estate. Nowadays, photographs look more realistic and colorful and vibrant, like the ones in National Geographic. I imagine that when Joseph Niepce took this photograph, he could have never foreseen the many directions photography has taken art over the years.
