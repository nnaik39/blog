title: Machine Learning Resources

Right after creAIte, a participant emailed me asking for more resources to get started in ML. I included parts of my response below:

Hi ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî,

I‚Äôm so glad you enjoyed learning about AI! Your email totally made my day. üôÇ By the way, you asked some very insightful questions during my presentations, so thank you so much for your curiosity and engagement.
Below are my recommendations for learning more!
For Python programming, I would recommend [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for learning the syntax. Codeacademy is an interactive system where you program code and test it out, so it can give you instant gratification. If you learn better from books, there is this free online book Learn Python the Hard Way which is pretty good.
Also Jupyter Notebook and Python is a great combination, a lot of machine learning people use it because you can mix code with explanations. Much of ML is open-source (aka anyone can work on the code).
For suggestions on how to pursue AI, there is really good content on the Internet but it can get very technical very fast. Below are some possible resources, mixing lecture and hands-on parts:
Google CodeLabs: Click the TensorFlow Category, and it can walk you through creating some content of your own. I think getting to play with actual code helps a lot. Also CodeLabs is great for coding in general.
Karpathy‚Äôs Blog: Karpathy doesn‚Äôt hold back on the technical details, but this blog is very well-known and he explains concepts really nicely. My personal favorites are, ‚ÄúWhat a Deep Neural Network thinks about Your #Selfie‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks.‚Äù
Andrew Ng‚Äôs Videos: These are really technical, but also classics and contain wonderful explanations. If you‚Äôre considering a career in AI, I‚Äôd recommend watching these sometime in your life.
Kaggle: AI competitions where the people in charge give you, for example, a leaf dataset and ask you to classify the leaves with ML! The best part is you have access to a ton of datasets and can see what code other people are writing. They also have a lot of tutorials. Personally, I never competed, I just learned from the tutorials. It helped me a ton.
There are a ton of libraries out there to make your life easier. I‚Äôd recommend learning Pandas, for data processing.
This open-source Jupyter notebook walks you through iris classification. This one is an introduction to scikit-learn, which is a machine learning library (similar to TensorFlow, which we used).
Also, Michael Nielsen wrote a beautiful book on Neural Networks and Deep Learning. I borrowed an example from it in my presentation to explain the concept of weights. It‚Äôs an amazing resource.
(I went a little overboard on this list. Please don‚Äôt feel pressured to get through all of it.)

I hope you find this list to be helpful!
