title: Machine Learning Resources
---

Right after creAIte, a participant emailed me asking for more resources to get started in ML. I included parts of my response below:

## Learning Python
* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for learning the syntax. Codeacademy is an interactive system where you program code and test it out, so it can give you instant gratification.
* If you learn better from books, there is this free online book [Learn Python the Hard Way (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) which is pretty good.
* There are a ton of libraries out there to make your life easier. I’d recommend learning [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html), for data processing.
* [This](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/example-data-science-notebook/Example%20Machine%20Learning%20Notebook.ipynb) open-source Jupyter notebook walks you through iris classification.

## Hands-on ML Resources
* [Google CodeLabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/): Click the TensorFlow Category, and it can walk you through creating some content of your own. I think getting to play with actual code helps a lot. Also CodeLabs is great for coding in general.
* [Kaggle](kaggle.com): AI competitions where the people in charge give you, for example, a leaf dataset and ask you to classify the leaves with ML! The best part is you have access to a ton of datasets and can see what code other people are writing. They also have a lot of tutorials. Personally, I never competed, I just learned from the tutorials. It helped me a ton.
* [TensorFlow Playground](playground.tensorflow.org)
* Karpathy’s [Blog](blog): Karpathy doesn’t hold back on the technical details, but this blog is very well-known and he explains concepts really nicely. My personal favorites are, “What a Deep Neural Network thinks about Your #Selfie”, and “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks.”

* Andrew Ng’s [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLJ_CMbwA6bT-n1W0mgOlYwccZ-j6gBXqE): These are really technical, but also classics and contain wonderful explanations. If you’re considering a career in AI, I’d recommend watching these sometime in your life.

* Also, Michael Nielsen wrote a beautiful book called [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
