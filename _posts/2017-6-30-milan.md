## Ah, Milan.
That wonderful place of gelato & fashion & sun tans.
The last stop on PYO's whirlwind Europe tour was in Milan, and I must confess, I was looking forward to it the most.

### The Food

After scarce vegetarian options in Germany and Austria, Italian food definitely lived up to its reputation! I had a cannoli,
spaghetti, and averaged around 2.5 gelatos per day. Flavors: strawberry, mint, grape, butterscotch.

### The Language

I've been trying to speak snippets of Italian, since I speak Spanish & Latin & sing opera. It's a naturally musical language,
with many open vowels, so just being surrounded by Italian speakers makes me feel very sunny. (People tend to associate
computer geekiness with an aversion to sunlight. This is not entirely untrue.)

Below are some key phrases I found myself using:

Un gelato fragola, per favore. -> One strawberry ice cream, please. (highly important)

Per favore -> Please

Grazie. (GRAH-zie) -> Thank you.

Prego. (PRAY-go) -> You're welcome!

Mi scusi. -> Pardon me.

Sono vegetariano. -> I'm a vegetarian!

### The Fashion

The shops in Milan are gorgeous and expensive. Some of the storeowners take their clothes very seriously; 
we were chased out of a shop! Most of them were very friendly, however. There's a big plaza with designer name stores like
Prada, and Versace. I ended up buying a bright red leather jacket. Pictures below!
